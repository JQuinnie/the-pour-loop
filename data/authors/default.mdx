Hey, hello there ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp; I'm Jenn!

I'm a software developer.

And like most software developers, I enjoy a highly caffeinated cup of coffee. But recently, I find myself also enjoying the process of brewing that cup of coffee. There is something extremely soothing, something undeniably relaxing about the process... taking the time to grind, brew and pour.

I've decided to document that journey.

Along this journey, I also plan to take quick detours to explore other interesting subjects like software development, mechanical keyboards and maybe even the uber exciting world of miniature collectibles.
