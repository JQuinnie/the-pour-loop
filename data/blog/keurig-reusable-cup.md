Sometimes we don't have time for a pourover, but we still want fresh coffee.

Before I had my pourover tools, I used a Keurig machine religiously... mainly because it was fast and easy. Now when I am pressed for time, I would grind some fresh beans close to the size of what you would find in a K-Cup and fill a reusable K-Cup. This way, I have fresh coffee and can still brew a fast cup with the Keurig. Grind the night before, set your Keurig for that morning rush out the door.

## Setup

- Keurig, any type (I use the [Keurig K-Cafe](https://amzn.to/3etzSKx))
- [Reuseable K-Cup](https://amzn.to/3Fx7ByM)
- Timemore Chestnut C2 grinder @ 14'

## Coffee

- fresh coffee beans @ 14g

## Process

- Keurig 10oz setting at normal strength

## Thoughts

The brew is faster so it tends to be not as bitter or as bold. But having fresh beans definitely takes it up a level from burnt dullness which is the usual flavor of k-cups.
