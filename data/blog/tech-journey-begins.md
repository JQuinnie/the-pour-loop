Although I am not writing this post on the date posted, I did however wanted to remember this day. I successfully acquired my Fullstack Web Development certificate on this day.

I remember the first time I got to work with HTML and web design. When I was young, my mother sent me to a computer class. All tiger mom's fill up their kid's weekend with Chinese school and other extracurricular academia classes. I was no different, except that she thought it was probably some sort of learn about computers class. Looking back, I am quite shocked that the Chinese learning center actually offered web design as a course. Maybe the it was just what that particular teacher knew... and I thank him for that. I grew to love web design very much so that I even spent my free time creating fan pages for celebrities hosted on Geocities and the likes during that time.

After that, life continued to happen and I graduated college with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. With that, I worked in the Oil and Gas Industry for many years as a subsea engineer. I've travelled offshore by vessel and helicopters onto rigs and such... I'll save those stories for another day, maybe.

Then 2018 was the year. The year I finished my Fullstack Web Development course and started working in tech! I felt blessed and loved the opportunities I was given.

Today I continue that journey, learning, building and immensely thankful.
