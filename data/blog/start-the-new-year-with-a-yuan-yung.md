Before I started getting into coffee or really enjoying coffee, I've drank mostly tea.

My perfect day would be:

> It's a sunny 72 degs out, laying in a hammock, under the shade with a big tall glass of iced tea.

I've drank tea ever since I was young. My parents often used to tell me the story of how when I was 4 years old, I would recite poems of Confucious, like the ["Three Character Classics"](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/San_Zi_Jing) for sips of my grandpa's tea.

So for Chinese New Years, I've decided to get some tea in the mix and have a [Yuan Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuenyeung). Yuan Yang is essentially a Cantonese version of milk tea with coffee. Hong Kong was under British rule for almost a century and the Cantonese people took to the English breakfast tea with milk.

A good ratio for yuan yang would be 3:7, 3 parts coffee and 7 parts tea. You can really play around with that ratio say if you prefer a stronger coffee taste, there is no hard rule on this.

## Setup

- Blue Bottle Dripper
- Kalita wave coffee paper filter
- Comandante C40 @ 26'
- [ForLife Bola Glass Teapot with Infuser 15oz](https://amzn.to/33YzOkA)
- 500ml carafe
- Purified water: 160g + 320g both @ 94C
- Condense milk, 30-50g

## Beans

- any fresh coffee beans @ 20g

## Tea

- any black tea @ 2.5g (I had some lovely English Breakfast black tea from [Unravel Coffee](https://unravel.coffee/))

## Process

I decided to increase the ratio of coffee to tea just a tad because then I can have the coffee ratio be the same as the [Iced pour over method](/blog/iced-pour-over) but without the ice.

Recommended - 3:7
My method - 1:2

This allowed me to have 160g of coffee to 320g of tea.

### Coffee Process

Three consectutive pours of 40g of water.

| Time | Water |
| :--: | :---: |
| 0:00 |  40g  |
| 0:40 |  80g  |
| 1:10 | 120g  |
| 1:40 | 160g  |

### Tea Process

For the tea, it was recommended a ratio of 2g of loose tea per 250g (8oz) of water. I went ahead and increased the tea ratio weight to 2.5g to get close to 320g of water as required above.

So I put 2.5g of loose leaf tea into pot and poured 320g of water and let it brew for 3-4 mins, while I am prepping the coffee.

### Add tea to coffee

When the coffee is finished, quickly add the tea to the coffee in a carafe or a cup that can hold 500ml. Give it a light stir then add condense milk, between 30g-50g... or a large spoonful to start then more to taste. Mix well and enjoy!

## Thoughts

The tea flavor is pretty strong so adjust your ratio accordingly. I used about 30g of condense milk, but I wouldn't object to 50g, haha. You can even use evaporated milk and sugar. The ratios here are a good starting point and adjust as you feel necessary. Having something different is kind of nice from time to time for me.

Oh and for reference, this uses a Hong Kong style milk tea, a bit different than the ever popular boba milk tea from Taiwan. Taiwanese milk teas uses fresh milk or creamer and the ratio of tea to milk is a lot less (weaker tasting) than Hong Kong style.
