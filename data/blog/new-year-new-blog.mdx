Happy New Year!!!

I am back from my long long hiatus...
I did say this is a new blog, well not exactly. It still looks and feels pretty much the same, but everything under the hood was updated.

The biggest and most painful hurdles were trying to bring all the npm packages 3 years forward. It was tough.

Here is a condensed summary of all the things that it took to make this update happen:

- Decide that it was time to get back to my blog (wipes off cobwebs)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and the [Tailwand-NextJS-Starter-Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) are outdated
  - Node from 16.13.1 to 20.18.0
  - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to newer compatible version 8.57.1
  - Tailwind Next JS updates NextJS from 11 to 14 (NextJS landscaped changed dramatically)
- Update content and styling to match my old blog
- Wrestle with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) deployment linter
- Take some notes of areas of future improvements

The <b class="font-bold italic">show stopper</b> was the NextJS update, it required a significant shift in how routing, data fetching, and component rendering are approached.
The new features introduced, especially with the App Router and Server Components, offer improved performance and better code organization but also some required some refactoring of existing codebases.\
After that, I decided to instead branch off of the new Tailwind-NextJS-Starter-Blog using NextJS 14 and slowly (painfully), moving my content over and with styling updates.
In hindsight, there probably would have been an easier way, but I had already went pretty deep down this path to make it back. It took me 3 months to do this update (a few hours here and there).

Now that the blog is up to date, I can keep calm and blog on into 2025! ðŸ¥‚
