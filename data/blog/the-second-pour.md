## Setup

Mostly the same as the first pour.

- Blue Bottle Dripper
- Blue Bottle bamboo filter
- Timemore Chestnut C2 grinder @ 20'
- Grocery store purified drinking water @ 200F
- Ratio 1:16 (~20g coffee to 320g water)

## Beans

[Cuvee El Salvador](https://cuveecoffee.com/)

- weigh-in @ 22g because some remain in the grinder

## Process

| Time | Water |
| :--: | :---: |
| 0:00 |  40g  |
| 0:40 | 150g  |
| 1:10 | 250g  |
| 1:40 | 320g  |

## Thoughts

I did not get all the coffee wet during the bloom session. I felt like I needed to pour faster to make the time markers, so I poured faster than yesterday. This resulted in uneven pour streams and not continuous. Today it tastes a bit bitter.
