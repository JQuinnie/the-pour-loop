When starting this pourover journey, it was very useful to reference the [Barista Hustle's Coffee Compass](https://www.baristahustle.com/blog/the-coffee-compass/) guide to tweak your brew depending on subjective taste. Once you can key in on a particular flavor or sense, it helps to know how to adjust accordingly.

I tend to get bitter and sour more than any other taste in a cup of coffee, mostly due to my underdeveloped palate and of course newb-ness to fine-tuning the pour.

### Bitter

Over-extracted.

Grind is too fine.

Use a coarser grind and/or shorter brew times to extract less.
Decrease brew ratio by using less water.

### Sour

Under-extracted.

Grind is too coarse.

Use a finer grind and/or longer brew time to extract more.
Increase brew ratio by using more water.
