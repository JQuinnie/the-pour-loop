## Pourover Ratio

Ratio is usually referring to brew strength, how strong or light you would like your coffee. The ratio is a great starting guideline but taste is subjective. It's good to start at the tested ratio (the starting place) and work your way up or down to find your perfect cup of joe. It's also good to note that the vast resources online do point to a 'golden ratio' range of (1:15-1:18), so anywhere along those markers are good bets.

| Ratio | Coffee : Water |              Notes               |
| :---: | :------------: | :------------------------------: |
| 1:15  |   20g : 300g   | Denser, for adding milk or cream |
| 1:16  |   20g : 320g   |        The starting place        |
| 1:17  |   20g : 340g   |   Lighter, for drinking black    |
