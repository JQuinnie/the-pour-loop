In my pourover details, I often times provide a table like the one below;

| Time | Water |
| :--: | :---: |
| 0:00 |  40g  |
| 0:40 | 150g  |
| 1:10 | 250g  |
| 1:40 | 320g  |

This is a chart detailing the pourover process I am using for that particular brew.

Prior to starting, I make sure I have hot water at the right temperature and that I've wetted the paper filter in the dripper with the water that also subsequently warms up the carafe/mug/cup. Dump the water out and you are ready to add the freshly ground coffee grounds. The coffee beans are weighed to the required weight and then hand-ground in the grinder at the specified click setting.

I start the time at 0:00 and pour 40g of hot water into the dripper; that is typically referred to the 'bloom' phase (1st pour/extraction). The bloom is when you get enough water to wet all the coffee grounds and then wait for a period of time to allow the CO2 gas to be released and escape. I pour slowly in a spiral fashion, starting at the center and then widening out, spiraling out then spiraling back into the center. My guide would be about 10-15s to finish the 40g pour (see more on flow rate below). The grounds will be saturated and start to swell. Homegrounds has a great article on the [Importance of the Coffee Bloom](https://www.homegrounds.co/coffee-bloom/).

Then comes the next time marker (2nd pour), at 0:40 or 40 seconds in, I pour 150g of hot water into the dripper as steady as I can with the same flow rate guidance. Repeat for the 3rd pour.

For the final pour, stick closer to the center, make small spirals pour extremely steady. I usually let the coffee settle up to 2:30min or 3min time marker. At the end of the pour, the coffee ground bed should look flat and even.

I know there is a lot of coffee skin... I'll have to address that at a later time.

#### After the final pour

This was at the 3 minute mark, the bed should be flat with a steady pour. I probably wasn't steady enough, therefore I ended up with some bubbles.

Adhering to the pour technique above, the water can flow without creating 'channels'. You are trying to avoid creating a paved path for the water to flow through (water flows in the path of least resistance), this way you allow the water to touch on all the grounds as much as possible. It creates a more balanced extraction.

Also good to remember these points when pouring:

- slow, concentric circles
- don't hit the sides
- keep a steady stream

## Pour Flow Rate

Aim for a 3-6g/s flow rate.

At 10s for 40g, the pour (flow) rate would be 4g/s. You are looking for a slow flow, more importantly, minimal speed/even flow (less turbulence).

Low flow (slow extraction) rate will increase the contact time of water and coffee but decrease the pressure of the water/coffee in the filter.

High flow (fast extraction) rate will decrease the contact time of the water and coffee but increase the pressure of the water/coffee in the filter.

With an understanding of flow, you can then see the correlation to extraction. Referring back to the [Coffee Compass](https://www.baristahustle.com/app-archive-main/the-coffee-compass/), if you have a slow extraction, it might mean 'over extracted' which could result in intense, bitter flavors. While a fast extraction might mean 'under extracted', which could result in sour and underwhelming flavors.

Coffee taste is subjective and half the fun is figuring out what you like given all these variables that you can control with a pourover coffee!
