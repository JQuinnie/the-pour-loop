This discovery is something I am thrilled to talk about; it was pretty life-changing.

In Texas, or any other location with HOT weather, one craves a cold beverage from time to time. For me, it was often times.

## Setup

- Blue Bottle Dripper
- Blue Bottle bamboo filter
- Timemore Chestnut C2 grinder @ 18' (Comandante C40 @ 26')
- Purified water: 160g @ 94C
- Filtered ice: 180g

## Beans

- any fresh coffee beans @ 20g

## Process

Put 180g of ice in a cup then follow the process below;

Three consectutive pours of 40g of water.

| Time | Water |
| :--: | :---: |
| 0:00 |  40g  |
| 0:40 |  80g  |
| 1:10 | 120g  |
| 1:40 | 160g  |

## Thoughts

The iced pourover cuts the acidity which was helpful for my developing palate as I was thinking most pourovers are quite acidic and sour by nature (more refined palates can identify those special traits and notes of the coffee).

You get a very smooth glass of iced coffee. It is my goto drink. The ice plus water adds up to 320g total which equal that of the traditional hot pourover.
