## Dripper

### Blue Bottle Dripper

I actually decided to buy the [Blue Bottle Pour Over Kit](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/store/blue-bottle-pour-over-kit) because it seemed like an easy starter set and it looks really nice. The most popular pour-over drippers out there are probably the [Hario V60](https://www.hario-usa.com/collections/drippers) and the [Kalita Wave](http://kalita.ae/products/dripper). The Blue Bottle dripper is more similar to the Kalita Wave with the ceramic flat-bottom brew style, this [review](https://coffeechronicler.com/review-blue-bottle-coffee-dripper/) does a great job at explaining some of the differences. To be honest, I bought it purely on aesthetics alone.

## Grinder

I wanted a rather inexpensive starter hand grinder and the Timemore Chestnut C2 delivered. It has an aluminum body and a stainless steel conical burr. The weight feels great in your hands, and the narrow cavity allows smaller hands to get a better grip during use.

I eventually got a Comandante C40, but I'll talk more about that at a later post.

## Scale

Simple to use and inexpensive as well. It has weight and timer functions and the recharge lasts quite a long time.

## Kettle

I was looking for a gooseneck kettle and this one did the trick. It has temperature settings in both F/C along with timer functions that I haven't used yet.
