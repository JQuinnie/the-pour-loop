Below is a chart of the grind size settings (in clicks) for 3 popular grinders, the Comandante C40, the [Timemore Chestnut C2](https://amzn.to/3HfHAo1) and the [Baratza Encore](https://amzn.to/3EsCFhz) (automatic). For very fine to fine it is recommended to use the Encore automatic grinder as hand grinders tend to have a harder time and less precision at that size\*.

Personally, my sweet spot for the C40 is 26' for pourovers.

|    Size     |              Application               |  C40   | Chestnut | Encore |
| :---------: | :------------------------------------: | :----: | :------: | :----: |
| Very Fine\* |             Turkish coffee             | 5-10'  |   0-6'   |  1-5'  |
|    Fine     |           Espresso, Mokapot            | 11-15' |  7-10'   | 5-10'  |
|  Med. Fine  |    Single-serving, pourover brewers    | 16-20' |  11-15'  | 10-15' |
|   Medium    | Aeropress, siphon, flat-bottom dripper | 21-25' |  16-20'  | 10-20' |
| Med. Coarse |         Chemex, clever dripper         | 26-30' |  21-23'  | 20-25' |
|   Coarse    |              French press              | 31-35' |  24-28'  | 25-30' |

- trading out the Comandante standard kit with a Red Clix kit will help you achieve more precision for fine grind size.
