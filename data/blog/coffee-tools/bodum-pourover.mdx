## Bodum Pourover

When I have to make coffee for a group of people (> 2ppl), I try to make use of my [Bodum Pourover Maker](https://amzn.to/3sRcWNG). For the most part, I do follow the prescribed [Bodum pourover guide](https://blog.bodum.com/article/how-to-make-delicious-coffee-with-bodum-pour-over) but with some minor tweaks.

Bodum recommends 7g per 125ml.

## Setup

- Comandante grinder @ 26'
- Grocery store purified drinking water @ 94C
- Ratio 7:125 (42g coffee to 750g water)

## Beans

- medium roast
- from Nashville, TN
- 42g in the grinder

## Process

| Time | Water |
| :--: | :---: |
| 0:00 | 150g  |
| 0:40 | 350g  |
| 1:10 | 550g  |
| 1:40 | 750g  |

## Thoughts

It was pretty hard to pour at a slow, steady flow rate for such a large amount of water. It turned to be more of a continuous pour and me just trying to be as steady as possible.

The taste was less full-bodied or more specifically, less unique in characteristics. I could not tell the special notes of the coffee, it was more like a regular big batch coffee. But, I would still take this method over a Keurig because of the fresh ground coffee beans.

The serving size was 7g to 125ml, which is about 4oz. I basically tripled the recommended serving size and split it amongst 3 ppl. That quantity was closer to a standard cup of coffee.
