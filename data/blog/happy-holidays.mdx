## Happy Holidays!

🎄🎁 &nbsp; ☕ Ho ☕ Ho ☕ Ho &nbsp;🎁🎄

I'm doing a bit of housekeeping during the holidays. You'll notice that blog posts might magically appear in the past... and that's because I am retro-actively posting. I have quite a bit of content backed up and haven't had the time to post them on a regular basis. Come next year, it'll be more chronologically posted.

Hope everyone is enjoying their holidays!
