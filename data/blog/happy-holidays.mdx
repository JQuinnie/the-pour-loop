## Happy Holidays!

🎄🎁 &nbsp; ☕ Ho ☕ Ho ☕ Ho &nbsp;🎁🎄

I'm doing a bit of housekeeping during the holidays. You'll notice that blog posts might magically appear in the past... and that's because I am retro-actively posting. I have quite a bit of content backed up and haven't had the time to post them on a regular basis. Come next year, it'll be more chronologically posted.

Hope everyone is enjoying their holidays!

  Why did the hipster burn his tongue?
  Because he drank his coffee before it was cool.
