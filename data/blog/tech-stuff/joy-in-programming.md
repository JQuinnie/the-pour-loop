Every so often, I come back to this topic...
I would love to spread the word and help more people find their passion in technology, specifically programming.

I didn't have the traditional career path leading to software development, but I always knew I'd love to do web design and development (read about [my journey into tech](/blog/tech-stuff/tech-journey-begins)). My first job as a developer was being a fullstack web teaching assistant for a web development bootcamp curriculum. I think it was during that time that I found out how much I enjoyed helping and mentoring those new to tech (read about [my guest post for new developers](/blog/tech-stuff/letters-to-a-new-developer)).

If you are new to tech or curious, I have a great list of resources below:

- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/): One of the best learn to code for free resources
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths): Explore fullstack development in either Ruby or JS
- [Javascript.io](https://javascript.info/intro): Detailed list of JS topics from beginner to advance
- [Frontend Developers Handbook](https://frontendmasters.com/guides/front-end-handbook/2019/): All about Frontend Web Development as an interactive booklet
- [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/): Fun, interactive way to learn SQL
- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/): Fun, interactive way to learn CSS Flexbox
- [CSS Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/): Fun, interactive way to learn CSS Grids
- [Github Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/): Github has integrated projects to learn Git and Github
- [Awesome Web Development Resources](https://github.com/markodenic/web-development-resources): Can't leave this gem off the list!

Maybe someday I'll find some mentees that share my same passion... until then, I'm going to start hanging out at MeetUps for some coffee and code!

And lastly, just for the giggles!
