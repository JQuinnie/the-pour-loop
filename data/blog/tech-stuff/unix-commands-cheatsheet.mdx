Another day, another cheatsheet?

Well, not trying to bombard the web with yet another cheatsheet, but I thought that this would be a good opportunity to refresh myself on UNIX and LINUX commands. I do not have a background in Computer Science, so I am just picking up these topics along the way to acquire a more well-rounded background knowledge base.

I'm not going to get into the details of Unix (see wiki [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix))... but I mostly need to have basic knowledge of the commands to navigate the terminal in Mac OS, most developers do.

The statement below kind of sums it up:

> > Mac OS X is a Unix OS and its command line is 99.9% the same as any Linux distribution. Bash is your default shell and you can compile all of the same programs and utilities.

Below is the lists of useful commands but keep in mind that I run MacOs with zsh so there might be some subtle differences in the command or command flags.

## Basic System Commands

| Command | Description                                | Example Usage |
| :-----: | ------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
|   man   | help docs, manual on the command           | man echo      |
| whoami  | the current user                           | whoami        |
|   cal   | display current month calendar             | cal           |
|  date   | display current date                       | date          |
| history | shows the history list of commands used    | history       |
| history | > -N, a flag to show last N commands (zsh) | history -10   |

When in `man` mode, pressing `q` will quit and close out that mode and pressing `spacebar` will advance to next section.

## Folders and File Commands

## CAT Commands

Concatenate (CAT) command is used frequently to read data from a file and gives the content as output.

## GREP Commands

Global search for regular expression and printout, global-regular-expression-print (grep), searches a file for a particular pattern of characters, and displays all lines that contain that pattern.

[GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/) has a collection of great resources with examples on the grep command as well as other Unix commands.

| :-----: | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
|  grep   | searches the file given a search term                    | grep "searchTerm" fileName             |
|  grep   | > -i, flag to ignore case sensitive                      | grep -i "searchTerm" fileName          |
|  grep   | > -n, flag to also return the line number of found       | grep -n "searchTerm" fileName          |
|  grep   | > -l, flag to return fileName if search found            | grep -l "searchTerm" fileName          |
|  grep   | > -w, flag that matches exact word                       | grep -w "searchTerm" fileName          |
|  grep   | > -v, flag that ignores the search term, returns inverse | grep -w "searchTerm" fileName          |
|  grep   | > -c, flag to display the count of search matches        | grep -c "searchTerm" fileName          |
|  grep   | chaining flags to search ignore case w/ line number      | grep -in "searchTerm" fileName         |
