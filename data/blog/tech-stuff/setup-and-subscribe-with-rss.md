My friend asked how can someone stay updated on new blog posts? My thought was let me go ahead and get RSS hooked up.

## What is RSS?

RSS is an acronym for Really Simple Syndication.

It is a simple way to stay up-to-date on the websites you care about. You can subscribe to a website using the RSS feed through a feed reader and have all the updates of that website (especially blogs) aggregated to the feed reader for your peruse at your convenience.

## How to set up your site to enable RSS feed

- For Next.js you can use functions similar in [this file](https://github.com/JQuinnie/the-pour-loop/blob/master/lib/generate-rss.js) to set up the RSS generate function
- Then, add the function to the `getStaticProps` section of your [blog path template](https://github.com/JQuinnie/the-pour-loop/blob/6950e8ace1a33b1acf036d614deaf8dbbb04f068/pages/blog/%5B...slug%5D.js#L34-L36)
  - The idea is that you add the RSS tags to the top of the HTML page for your `feed.xml`
  - The [Nextjs starter template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) that I am using, comes pre-built with RSS feature
- Validate that your RSS feeds are valid via a [Feed Validator](https://validator.w3.org/feed/)
- Add a RSS icon to your page with your feed link (`/feed.xml`)
  - I use free svg icons from [Icon Finder](https://www.iconfinder.com/)

## How to subscribe to The Pour Loop RSS Feed

- Set up an account with any feed reader, the most popular is [Feedly](https://www.feedly.com)

- At the [main page](https://feedly.com/i/discover) you can discover and add any websites you wish to follow

👉 Do a search for **'www.thepourloop.com'** or **'www.thepourloop.com/feed.xml'**
👉 Click on the **'FOLLOW'** button on the top right to subscribe

Afterwards, it should be in your feed to read at any time. All new updates to the website will be generated there.
